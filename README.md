# dzk-ras-signaling-in-tcell
This is a Ras signaling model in T cell reported in Joshi et al. Science Signaling 2013; PMID: 24280043. The codes are written in Stochastic Simulation Compiler (SSC). These codes were previously available in http://planetx.nationwidechildrens.org/~jayajit/. The planetx link does not work anymore. 

This is a well mixed Ras signaling in T cells published in Joshi et al. Science Signaling 2013; PMID: 24280043. The codes are written in Stochastic Simulation Compiler (SSC). These codes were previously available in http://planetx.nationwidechildrens.org/~jayajit/.

The .rxn files are codes that can be compiled via a stochastic simulation compiler (SSC) available for free at http://web.mit.edu/irc/ssc/ . Each of the codes needs an input file (or .cfg file). The corresponding .cfg files are also uploaded.
